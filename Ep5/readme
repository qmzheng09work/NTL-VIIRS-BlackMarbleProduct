This episode of tutorial talks about
(1) to-be-cautious issue when applying my codes for pre-processing Black Marble data and 
(2) the missing tile issue (including my code to identify missing tiles; see [check_missing_tile.m]
check my tutorial video in https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bT4y1r7Gv/

Ps: missing tile means that a certain tile-year-doy is missing the NASA's database (e.g., h30v05, 2016273)
check: 
missing tile "20160273.h30v05" in https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/5000/VNP46A2/2016/273/
while tiles in other year-doy exist: https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/5000/VNP46A2/2016/272/
