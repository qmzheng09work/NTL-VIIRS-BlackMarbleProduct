# NTL-VIIRS-BlackMarbleProduct

## Introduction
This repo is to share some of personal codes, as well as tips and tricks, for downloading, (pre-) processing and playing with the NASA's Black Marble Product suite for VIIRS nighttime light data.

I intend to create a series of short video tutorials along with the codes, which will be posted here and Youtube/Bilibili. The following contents will be shared:
>> * [EP1] Brief introduction of Black Marble Product (VNP46A2) 
>> * Code and tips for downloading a huge volume (>1000 tiles) of VNP46A2 data
>> * Brief introduction of the quality control layers of VNP46A2 data
>> * Codes and tips for format conversion (HDF to geotiff), layer extraction, image clip and mosaicking.
>> * Things to be careful when using VNP46A2 data
>> * Other VNP46 data

Currently, I am collating codes and recording tutorials. Please keep update this repo and [my twitter](https://twitter.com/QimingZheng2).
